                <h2>Our Office</h2>
                <p>In order to maximise the benefit our clients obtain from the funding we receive, all of our staff work remotely and schedule their time according to the needs of their clients. Unfortunately, this means we do not maintain a presence at our office, and any in-person meetings will be by appointment only.</p>

                <h2>Donations</h2>
                <p>As a charity we rely on donations to enable us to provide our service free of charge to as many Orkney residents as we can. If you are interested in making a donation please you can send a cheque, made out to Advocacy Orkney, to our office address.</p>
                <p>If you are unable to send cheque, but still wish to donate, please contact the service manager to arrange an alternate method of donation.</p>
                <!-- Investigate online donations? -->

                <h2> Referrals</h2>
                <p> If you know someone that you feel may benefit from having an advocate, and you have gained their consent for us to contact them, or if you yourself would like to speak with an advocate, you can contact the service manager at so that we can arrange for you to speak with the approriate advocate.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, please fill in and send us a <a href="#">referral form</a>. Referral forms can be sent to us via post, or via email.</p>
